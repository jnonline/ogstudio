= Install MinGW (compiler) =
- Install the latest MinGW intaller with pre-packaged repository into C:/MinGW from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/
-- Only select C and C++ compilers.
- Add C:/MinGW/bin to %PATH%.

= Install CMake (builder) =
- Install the latest CMake from: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
-- At the Install Options screen select:
--- Add CMake to the system PATH for all users 
--- Create CMake Desktop Icon

= Install Cygwin (environment) ==
- Install it without selecting additional packages into C:/cygwin. Only select at least 2 mirrors from which to download packages (into C:/cygwin_packages, e.g.).
- Rename sh.exe to sh_.exe, otherwise CMake won't compile anything.
- Install additional packages by running the following command: 
```
setup.exe -P bz2,gz,mercurial,openssh,patch,subversion,vim,wget,unzip
```
It will run the same sequence of dialogs. Just keep on pressing "Next", and it will install everything as needed.
