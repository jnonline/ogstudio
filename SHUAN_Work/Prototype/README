OGS Shuan Gameplay slice prototype
This is not a game. It just a tool to adjust some gameplay features while there is no actual game to do it.

Requires pygame to work.

Sprites taken from here: http://www.flyingyogi.com/fun/spritelib.html
Mars surface photo found somewhere in google and was originally created by NASA.

Great thanks to http://www.scriptedfun.com/ for scroll shooter code example
