# Nice tradition #

In real life, parents raise children. Children later help parents when they become old.
It's a distribution of help, law of conservation of energy, if you wish. First, you help others, then others help you.

In open source world many projects seek donations, because it's very hard to work on something if you spend time on it, and it doesn't give you means for living.

We decided to donate to projects we use each release.
